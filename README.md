# üöÄ Intensive Rust Bootcamp ‚Äì Zero to Advanced

Master Rust from systems programming to backend engineering through hands-on projects and deep memory control.

---

## üìö Bootcamp Overview

**Day 1: Rust Essentials & Memory Management**

* Rust vs C++/Java (syntax, memory, error handling)
* Data Types, Conditions, Functions
* Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes (RAII model)
* Arrays, Tuples, Slices
* **Hands-on:** Ownership demos, Stack vs Heap diagrams, Mini CLI tools

---

**Day 2: Control Flow, Structs & Error Handling**

* `if`, `match`, pattern guards
* Structs, Enums, Destructuring
* `Result`, `Option`, custom errors, `?` operator
* **Hands-on:** Enum shapes, error propagation, mini UPI app

---

**Day 3: OOP in Rust**

* Structs, Traits, Generics, `dyn`, Trait Bounds
* Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism
* **Hands-on:** Banking/UPIApp simulator using OOP + Traits

---

**Day 4: Lifetimes, Collections & Memory Safety**

* Generics, HashMap, Rc, Arc, Vec
* Borrow checker, lifetimes, phantom types
* **Hands-on:** CLI task tracker, Vec filtering, safe data aggregation

---

**Day 5: Traits, Smart Pointers, Macros, Async**

* Smart Pointers: Box, Rc, Arc, RefCell
* Async Rust (Tokio), Futures, Macros, Modules, Crates
* **Hands-on:** Async downloader, Trait-based dynamic dispatch, FFI basics

---

**Day 6: Fearless Concurrency**

* Threads vs Async
* Channels, Mutex, Atomic types
* Unsafe Rust, raw pointers, FFI with C
* **Hands-on:** High-performance async logger framework

---

**Day 7: Framework Integration & Full-Stack Development**

* REST APIs with Actix-web, SeaORM, PostgreSQL
* WebSockets, gRPC with Tonic
* **Hands-on:** REST CRUD API, WebSocket system, Wasm module integration

---

**Day 8‚Äì9: Real-World Project Building**

* CLI tools, REST APIs, gRPC microservices
* Async servers, Database integrations, WebAssembly modules
* Projects:

  * Digital Wallet CLI
  * File-backed Key-Value Store
  * Airline Booking Engine
  * Concurrent Banking Transaction Processor
  * In-memory Cache with Expiry
